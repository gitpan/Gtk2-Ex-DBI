Below is a list of things which probably need attention, along with comments on
whether I think *I'm* going to do anything about them, and other comments / considerations.

If you're looking for something to do, you just found it.
None of these ( apart from search functionality ) should take particularly long - just
someone who knows what they're doing ( which is why I've left them out )

---

- Search functionality: the most likely addition I'd add if / when spare time allows
    Still thinking about which way to go here. Options:
	- Full-blown dialog for advanced searching on multiple fields
	- Simple single-field search
    Considerations:
	- should we use SQL or regex to find matches?

---

- Fetch default values from DB server: possibility in the mid-range, no burning need
    Is this possible? Is there anything in DBI that provides default values, or do we have to parse
	the output of a 'show create table' statement ( MySQL only ) or something?

---

- Possible workaround for Gnome2::DateEdit's insistance on always displaying a date ( ie no NULLs ): not interested in this any more
    Better to wait for upstream fix to what I consider a broken widget
    
---

- Adding support for more DB servers: don't have access to other DB servers / not interested
    - Postgres
	My last_insert_id doesn't currently work - needs a glance from someone who knows how to make it work
	Perhaps we can use 'select @@IDENTITY' if I can't make $dbh->last_insert_id work?
    - Oracle
	Completely untested
	See Postgres
