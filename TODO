- Fetch default values from DB server
    Is this possible? Is there anything in DBI that provides default values, or do we have to parse
	the output of a 'show create table' statement ( MySQL only ) or something?

- Possible workaround for Gnome2::DateEdit's insistance on always displaying a date?
    Not sure what I'd do though

- Adding support for more DB servers
    - Postgres
	last_insert_id doesn't currently work
	Perhaps we can use 'select @@IDENTITY' if I can't make $dbh->last_insert_id work?

    - Oracle: completely untested
    
- Demo app
    Just don't have time at the moment...
