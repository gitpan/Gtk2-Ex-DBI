Below is a list of things which probably need attention, along with comments on
whether I think *I'm* going to do anything about them, and other comments / considerations.

If you're looking for something to do, you just found it.
None of these ( apart from search functionality ) should take particularly long - just
someone who knows what they're doing ( which is why I've left them out )

---

- Search functionality: the most likely addition I'd add if / when spare time allows
    Still thinking about which way to go here. Options:
	- Full-blown dialog for advanced searching on multiple fields
	- Simple single-field search
    Considerations:
	- should we use SQL or regex to find matches?

- Adding support for more DB servers: don't have access to other DB servers / not interested
    - Oracle
	Completely untested
    - SQL Server
	Unstable - driver issue? Works intermittently
